The project containing all the assets to build the game is over 3GB, and the folder containing the build version is 200MB. 

Both of these exceeding Faser's upload limit of 50MB means that the project and the build folders have been placed on the CSEE GitLab in the repository created for Team 11.

The scipts used in Sticky Beaking have been uploaded to Faser, however are effectively useless outside of the project context. 

Also included is a brief user document explaining how to play.


The only difference between the upload on Faser and the upload on CSEE git is the build folder and project folder, we hope this is ok.
